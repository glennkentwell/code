Bits of code 
====

Mostly just experiments and little proof-of-concepts/spike solutions to try out languages etc.  Languages here so far:
* [Javascript](/glennkentwell/code/tree/master/js "")
* [PHP](/glennkentwell/code/tree/master/php "")
* [bash shell](/glennkentwell/code/tree/master/scr "")
* [Python](/glennkentwell/code/tree/master/python "")

...and some of my high school adventures with Turbo Pascal, haha :)
* [Pascal]  
(/glennkentwell/code/tree/master/pascal "") (I was a bit into Turbo Pascal 7.0 in the 90s haha)
